        <h2 class="header">What are Oxford commas?</h2>
        <p>The Oxford comma, also known as the serial comma or the Harvard comma, is an essential type of punctuation. They occur immediately before a coordinating conjunction in a list of three or more items. The purpose of an Oxford comma is to provide clarity to a phrase. Its absence can lead to different meanings of sentences&mdash;some of which can have $10 million implications!</p>
